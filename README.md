# OptimalRunningSpeed
Calculates the pace and speed for a half marathon based on the results of a shorter test run.
The idea was sparked from the website http://www.runningforfitness.org/
The calculations are described on this page: http://www.runningforfitness.org/faq/vo2-max

This could later be extended, a few ideas are:
- calculating the VO2max from a Cooper Test (VO2max = (d12 â€“ 505) : 45 [d12 is the distance run in 12 minutes in meters])
- support the same calculations based on a lactate test and the resulting VO2max
- add GPS support and use the app to track the test run directly
- add support for a Heart Rate Monitor
